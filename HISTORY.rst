.. _uritemplate.py: https://github.com/sigmavirus24/uritemplate

0.7.0: 2013-05-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix ``Issue.close``, ``Issue.reopen``, and ``Issue.assign``. (Issue #106)

- Add ``check_authorization`` to the ``GitHub class`` to cover the `new part 
  of the API <http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#check-an-authorization>`_.

- Add ``create_file``, ``update_file``, ``delete_file``, 
  ``iter_contributor_statistics``, ``iter_commit_activity``, 
  ``iter_code_frequency`` and ``weekly_commit_count`` to the ``Repository`` 
  object.

- Add ``update`` and ``delete`` methods to the ``Contents`` object.

- Add ``is_following`` to the ``User`` object.

- Add ``head``, ``base`` parameters to ``Repository.iter_pulls``.

- The signature of ``Hook.edit`` has changed since that endpoint has changed 
  as well. See: 
  github/developer.github.com@b95f291a47954154a6a8cd7c2296cdda9b610164

- ``github3.GitHub`` can now be used as a context manager, e.g.,
  ::

       with github.GitHub() as gh:
           u = gh.user('sigmavirus24')

0.6.1: 2013-04-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add equality for labels courtesy of Alejandro Gomez (@alejandrogomez)

0.6.0: 2013-04-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``sort`` and ``order`` parameters to ``github3.GitHub.search_users`` and 
  ``github3.GitHub.search_repos``.

- Add ``iter_commits`` to ``github3.gists.Gist`` as a means of re-requesting 
  just the history from GitHub and iterating over it.

- Add minimal logging (e.g., ``logging.getLogger('github3')``)

- Re-organize the library a bit. (Split up repos.py, issues.py, gists.py and a 
  few others into sub-modules for my sanity.)

- Calling ``refresh(True)`` on a ``github3.structs.GitHubIterator`` actually 
  works as expected now.

- API ``iter_`` methods now accept the ``etag`` argument as the
  ``GitHub.iter_`` methods do.

- Make ``github3.octocat`` and ``github3.github.GitHub.octocat`` both support
  sending messages to make the Octocat say things. (Think cowsay)

- Remove vendored dependency of PySO8601.

- Split ``GitHub.iter_repos`` into ``GitHub.iter_user_repos`` and 
  ``GitHub.iter_repos``. As a consequence ``github3.iter_repos`` is now 
  ``github3.iter_user_repos``

- ``IssueComment.update`` was corrected to match GitHub's documentation

- ``github3.login`` now accepts an optional ``url`` parameter for users of the 
  ``GitHubEnterprise`` API, courtesy of Kristian Glass (@doismellburning)

- Several classes now allow their instances to be compared with ``==`` and 
  ``!=``. In most cases this will check the unique id provided by GitHub. In 
  others, it will check SHAs and any other guaranteed immutable and unique 
  attribute. The class doc-strings all have information about this and details 
  about how equivalence is determined.

0.5.3: 2013-03-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add missing optional parameter to Repository.contents. Thanks @tpetr

0.5.2: 2013-03-02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Stop trying to decode the byte strings returned by ``b64decode``. Fixes #72

0.5.1: 2013-02-21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Hot fix an issue when a user doesn't have a real name set

0.5: 2013-02-16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- 100% (mock) test coverage

- Add support for the announced_ meta_ endpoint.

- Add support for conditional refreshing, e.g.,

  ::

      import github3

      u = github3.user('sigmavirus24')

      # some time later

      u.refresh()  # Will ALWAYS send a GET request and lower your ratelimit
      u.refresh(True)  # Will send the GET with a header such that if nothing
                       # has changed, it will not count against your ratelimit
                       # otherwise you'll get the updated user object.

- Add support for conditional iterables. What this means is that you can do:

  ::

      import github3

      i = github3.iter_all_repos(10)

      for repo in i:
          # do stuff

      i = github3.iter_all_repos(10, etag=i.etag)

  And the second call will only give you the new repositories since the last 
  request. This mimics behavior in `pengwynn/octokit`_

- Add support for `sortable stars`_.

- In github3.users.User, ``iter_keys`` now allows you to iterate over **any** 
  user's keys. No name is returned for each key. This is the equivalent of 
  visiting: github.com/:user.keys

- In github3.repos.Repository, ``pubsubhubbub`` has been removed. Use 
  github3.github.Github.pubsubhubbub instead

- In github3.api, ``iter_repo_issues``'s signature has been corrected.

- Remove ``list_{labels, comments, events}`` methods from github3.issues.Issue

- Remove ``list_{comments, commits, files}`` methods from 
  github3.pulls.PullRequest

- In github3.gists.Gist:

  - the ``user`` attribute was changed by GitHub and is now the ``owner`` 
    attribute

  - the ``public`` attribute and the ``is_public`` method return the same 
    information. The method will be removed in the next version.

  - the ``is_starred`` method now requires authentication

  - the default ``refresh`` method is no longer over-ridden. In a change made 
    in before, a generic ``refresh`` method was added to most objects. This 
    was overridden in the Gist object and would cause otherwise unexpected 
    results.

- ``github3.events.Event.is_public()`` and ``github3.events.Event.public`` now 
  return the same information. In the next version, the former will be 
  removed.

- In github3.issues.Issue

  - ``add_labels`` now returns the list of Labels on the issue instead of a 
    boolean.

  - ``remove_label`` now retuns a boolean.

  - ``remove_all_labels`` and ``replace_labels`` now return lists. The former 
    should return an empty list on a successful call. The latter should 
    return a list of ``github3.issue.Label`` objects.

- Now we won't get spurious GitHubErrors on 404s, only on other expected 
  errors whilst accessing the json in a response. All methods that return an 
  object can now *actually* return None if it gets a 404 instead of just 
  raising an exception. (Inspired by #49)

- GitHubStatus API now works.

    {0}"""

    print(template.format(r))
    # Some kind of template where you mention this repository
    # sigmavirus24/github3.py

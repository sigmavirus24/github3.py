# Security Policy

github3.py takes security seriously. Any vulnerability discovered in the
library will be addressed with best possible urgency. This is, however,
a passion project that I may not have enough time to spend in order to fix
a larger security issue in an expedient fashion.

All reports will be responded to within 7 days.

## Supported Versions

The latest version is the only supported version for security reports. We do
not maintain branches for older versions or long term support releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the security tab on GitHub to report a vulnerability. If this is
insufficient, please use the email address for @sigmavirus24.

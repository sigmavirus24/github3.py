Issue Code Examples
===================

Examples using ``Issue``\ s

Administrating Issues
---------------------

Let's assume you have your username and password stored in ``user`` and ``pw``
respectively, you have your repository name stored in ``repo``, and the number
of the issue you're concerned with in ``num``.

::

    from github3 import login

    gh = login(user, pw)
    issue = gh.issue(user, repo, num)
    if issue.is_closed():
        issue.reopen()

    issue.edit('New issue title', issue.body + '\n------\n**Update:** Text to append')

Closing and Commenting on Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    # Assuming issue is the same as above ...
    issue.create_comment('This should be fixed in 6d4oe5. Closing as fixed.')
    issue.close()

Example issue to comment on
---------------------------

If you would like to test the above, see
`issue #109 <https://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py/issues/108>`_. Just 
follow the code there and fill in your username, password (or token), and 
comment message. Then run the script and watch as the issue opens in your 
browser focusing on the comment **you** just created.

The following shows how you could use github3.py to fetch and display your
issues in your own style and in your webbrowser.

.. include:: source/browser.py
    :code: python

Or how to do the same by wrapping the lines in your terminal.

.. include:: source/wrap_text.py
    :code: python

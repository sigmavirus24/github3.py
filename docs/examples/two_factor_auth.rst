Using Two Factor Authentication with github3.py
===============================================

GitHub recently added support for Two Factor Authentication to ``github.com`` 
and shortly thereafter added support for it on ``api.github.com``. In version 
0.8, github3.py also added support for it and you can use it right now.

To use Two Factor Authentication, you must define your own function that will 
return your one time authentication code. You then provide that function when 
logging in with github3.py.

For example:

.. code::

    import github3

    try:
        # Python 2
        prompt = raw_input
    except NameError:
        # Python 3
        prompt = input

    def my_two_factor_function():
        code = ''
        while not code:
            # The user could accidentally press Enter before being ready,
            # let's protect them from doing that.
            code = prompt('Enter 2FA code: ')
        return code

    g = github3.login('sigmavirus24', 'my_password',
                      two_factor_callback=my_two_factor_function)

Then each the API tells github3.py it requires a Two Factor Authentication 
code, github3.py will call ``my_two_factor_function`` which prompt you for it.

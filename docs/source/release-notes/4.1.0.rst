4.1.0: 2025-xx-xx
-----------------

Features Added
``````````````

- Add support for multiple assignees for
  :meth:`github3.issues.issue.Issue.close` and
  :meth:`github3.issues.issue.Issue.reopen`. This prevents extra-assignees from
  being unassigned if an issue is closed and allows re-opening the issue with
  the same set of assignees.

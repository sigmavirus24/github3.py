        present because GitHub stopped returning the comment that caused
        the notification.

        ``unread`` attribute.

    .. attribute:: id

        The unique identifier for this notification across all GitHub
        notifications.

    .. attribute:: last_read_at

        A :class:`~datetime.datetime` object representing the date and time
        when the authenticated user last read this thread.

    .. attribute:: reason

        The reason the authenticated user is receiving this notification.

    .. attribute:: repository

        A :class:`~github3.repos.ShortRepository` this thread originated on.

    .. attribute:: subject

        A dictionary with the subject of the notification, for example, which
        issue, pull request, or diff this is in relation to.

    .. attribute:: unread

        A boolean attribute indicating whether this thread has been read or
        not.

    .. attribute:: updated_at

        A :class:`~datetime.datetime` representing the date and time when this
        thread was last updated.

class Comparison(models.GitHubCore):
    """A representation of a comparison between two or more commit objects.

    See also:
    http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#compare-two-commits

    This object has the following attributes::

    .. attribute:: ahead_by

        The number of commits between the head and base commit.

    .. attribute:: base_commit

        A :class:`~github3.repos.commit.ShortCommit` representing the base
        commit in this comparison.

    .. attribute:: behind_by

        The number of commits the head commit is behind the base.

    .. attribute:: original_commits

        .. versionchanged:: 4.0.0


        A list of :class:`~github3.repos.commit.ShortCommit` objects
        representing up to the first 250 commits in the comparison.

        If a comparison has more than 250 commits, use the commits function
        to iterate over all available commits.

    .. attribute:: diff_url

        The URL to retrieve the diff between the head and base commits.

    .. attribute:: files

        A list of dictionaries describing each of the modified files in the
        comparison.

    .. attribute:: html_url

        The URL to view the comparison in a browser.

    .. attribute:: patch_url

        The URL to retrieve the patch-formatted diff of this comparison.

    .. attribute:: permalink_url

        The permanent URL to retrieve this comparison.

    .. attribute:: status

        Whether the head commit is ahead or behind of base.

    .. attribute:: total_commits

        The total number of commits difference.

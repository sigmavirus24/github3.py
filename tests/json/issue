{"body": "We use the `_api` attribute to make constructing urls for objects. After a discussion today with GitHub support, it seems as if they'll be using the `url` parameter in the json objects for the same url with parameters in the future. This change was recently made (possibly accidentally) breaking what functionality I had relied on (although they fixed it once I reported it).\n\nFrom now on, to keep with that functionality, I'll have to construct these urls myself (the form I was intending on relying upon).\n\nAnother option I have is to just strip off the parameters and save those elsewhere in case the API starts to require
